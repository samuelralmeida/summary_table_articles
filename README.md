# Summary table of articles #

All scientific research in its initial phase has a bibliographic review stage.
The goal is to know what science knows about the subject and to discover methods
and discussions that are at the frontier of that knowledge.

In this step are read tens or hundreds of articles, and often retrieving this
information is time consuming or tiring. So a digital synthesis frame allows
orderly storage and retrieval of this information.
